/**
 * A Location is a point in a 2D coordinate system, with increasing x from west
 * to east and increasing y from south to north (ordinary mathematical
 * coordinates). Locations are represented with two doubles, (with an
 * unspecified length unit - could be kilometers, for example), and have a fixed
 * origin in the middle of Auckland.
 * 
 * Points, on the other hand, represent pixel positions on the screen. A Point
 * is described by two integers: x pixels across and y pixels down. Note the y
 * coordinate has its direction flipped from Location objects.
 * 
 * Methods are provided to convert between these two coordinate systems, but
 * this conversion requires an origin Location (a Location at the origin will be
 * converted to the point (0,0), which is probably the top-left of the screen),
 * and a scale specifying how many pixels per length unit. Typically the scale
 * will be ( windowSize /(maxLocation - minLocation) ).
 * 
 * Finally, a method is provided to convert out of the latitude-longitude
 * coordinate system used in the input files and into the Location coordinate
 * system.
